                <p>We are here to elevate men’s fashion in America by providing great clothes. This does not mean that our clothes is just simple clothing that you can find at Costco or Walmart, but clothing with some extra flair and personality to them. We believe that every guy is different and that by allowing him to play with their clothes, they can express themselves more uniquely. </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>We are aware that the market is saturated with clothing. However compared to women’s fashion, the amount of fashionable clothes for men in the low-end market is minimum. We want to change that. Because women dominate the fashion market, the supply of men’s clothing is disproportionally low causing a missing niche of quality low cost clothing. Men thus have to settle for what he has and men’s fashion can’t elevate. We will commit to changing that. </p>
