		        <p><i>Why did the two programmers and an engineer cross the road?</p> 
		        <p>To Sell CLOTHES! Ahhaha~</p>
		        <br></br>
		        <p>We are three guys who woke up one night with a vision that one day all guys will be able to wear good fitting and stylish clothing. As we woke up, we noticed this was not happening. Digging deeper, we derived at one culprint. There needs to be more clean, fitted clothing in the low-end fashion market in order for this to happen and we want to pave that. We believe that every guy should be able to find affordable good clothing in today’s market instead of heading to Walmart because he is money-conscious. </p>
		        <br></br>
		        <p>We noticed that the proportion of guys who dress themselves well is just too low. Thats a shame and we want to change that. We want to make men’s fashion simple and easy to get into. By providing clothes that people will compliment and alone makes you feel good, we want to instill confidence and joy in men as they head out into the world looking like kings. We want to make men realize that fashion isn’t all that bad but its actually fun. And that’s what we are about – fun.  </p>
